 # Chatbot with Gemini AI
 
 This is a simple chatbot web application built with Node.js, Express, and the Gemini AI API.  It allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by Gemini's language model through a simple web interface.
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
 *   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
 *   A Google Cloud account with access to the Gemini API
 *   An API key for the Gemini API
 
 ## Setup
 
 1.  **Clone the repository:**
 
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repository-link>
     cd chatbot-hacktiv-final
     ```
 
 2.  **Install dependencies:**
 
     ```bash
     npm install  # or yarn install
     ```
 
 3.  **Configure environment variables:**
 
     Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
 
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
     PORT=3000  # or your preferred port
     ```
 
     **Note:**  Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.  It's already ignored by the included `.gitignore`.
 
 4.  **Start the server:**
 
     ```bash
     node index.js  # or npm start if you've set up a start script in package.json
     ```
 
 5.  **Open the application in your browser:**
 
     Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured).
 
 ## How it Works
 
 *   The frontend (in `public/`) provides a simple HTML form for users to enter their messages.
 *   `script.js` handles user input and sends it to the backend via a POST request to `/api/chat`.
 *   The backend (in `index.js`) uses Express.js to handle the API request.
 *   It receives the user's message and uses the GoogleGenAI library to interact with the Gemini API.
 *   Gemini generates a response, which is sent back to the frontend.
 *   `script.js` then displays the bot's reply in the chat interface.
 
 ##  Key Files
 
 *   `index.js`:  The main server file, handling API requests and communication with Gemini.
 *   `public/index.html`:  The main HTML file for the user interface.
 *   `public/script.js`:  Handles frontend logic, including sending messages and updating the chat display.
 
 ## Potential Improvements
 
 *   Add error handling and user feedback for API failures.
 *   Implement a loading indicator while waiting for Gemini's response.
 *   Improve the styling of the chat interface.
 *   Add user authentication for a more personalized experience.
 *   Explore more advanced Gemini features, such as multi-turn conversations or different models.
